# Flight Specialist Agent - GPT-4.1 Upgrade Summary

## Overview

Successfully simplified the Flight Specialist Agent to use ONLY 2 tools and rewrote the system prompt following GPT-4.1 best practices from the official OpenAI prompting guide.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. **Simplified Tool Architecture** ✅

**BEFORE** (3 tools - complex workflow):
- `flight_search` - search flights
- `update_flight_airports` - store IATA codes
- `web_search` - find IATA codes

**Workflow was**: web_search → update_flight_airports → flight_search

**AFTER** (2 tools - streamlined workflow):
- `flight_search` - search flights AND accept IATA codes directly
- `web_search` - find IATA codes and other info

**New workflow**: flight_search → web_search → flight_search (with IATA codes)

### 2. **Enhanced flight_search Tool**

**New capabilities**:
- Accepts IATA codes directly as parameters (`origin_iata`, `destination_iata`)
- Accepts airport metadata (`origin_airport_name`, `origin_distance_km`, etc.)
- Automatically syncs IATA codes to both `flights` and `summary` contexts
- Two-phase operation:
  - **Phase 1**: Store city names, identify missing IATA codes
  - **Phase 2**: Accept IATA codes from web_search and call flight API

**New parameters**:
```javascript
{
  origin: "Nellore",
  origin_iata: "TIR",              // NEW: Direct IATA code input
  origin_airport_name: "Tirupati Airport",  // NEW: Airport metadata
  origin_distance_km: 120,         // NEW: Distance info
  destination: "Goa",
  destination_iata: "GOI",         // NEW: Direct IATA code input
  destination_airport_name: "...", // NEW: Airport metadata
  destination_distance_km: 0,      // NEW: Distance info
  // ... other existing parameters
}
```

### 3. **GPT-4.1 Optimized System Prompt**

Following the official OpenAI GPT-4.1 prompting guide, the new prompt includes:

#### **A. Agentic Reminders (Critical)**

```
1. PERSISTENCE: Keep going until query is completely resolved
2. TOOL-CALLING: Use tools to gather information - don't guess
3. PLANNING: Plan extensively before each tool call, think out loud
```

#### **B. Clear Tool Descriptions**

- Detailed "when to call" instructions
- Two-phase workflow examples
- Required parameters clearly listed
- CheapOair loyalty rules for web_search

#### **C. Complete Workflow Documentation**

5-step process:
1. Gather Information
2. Call flight_search (Initial)
3. Resolve Airport IATA Codes via web_search
4. Call flight_search (Final with IATA codes)
5. Present Results

#### **D. Concrete Example Interaction**

Full end-to-end example showing:
- Agent thinking out loud
- Sequential tool calls
- Extracting info from search results
- Final presentation to user

#### **E. Pre-Response Checklist**

Ensures agent verifies:
- Called flight_search appropriately
- Used web_search for IATA codes
- Presented results with CheapOair link
- Avoided other booking websites

## File Changes

### `src/ai/multiAgentSystem.js`

1. **Removed**: `update_flight_airports` tool (line ~540-573)
2. **Updated**: `flight_search` tool parameters and logic
   - Added IATA code parameters
   - Added airport metadata parameters
   - Enhanced context update logic
   - Improved tool response messages
3. **Updated**: `flightSpecialistAgent` definition
   - Changed from 3 tools to 2 tools
   - Now: `[flight_search, webSearchTool()]`

### `src/ai/handoff-prompt.js`

1. **Replaced**: Entire `FLIGHT_SPECIALIST` prompt (lines ~3643-3925)
2. **Structure**:
   - Agentic reminders upfront
   - Tool usage with examples
   - Complete 5-step workflow
   - Pre-response checklist
   - Concrete example interaction
   - Key success factors

- Reduced from 3 tools to 2 tools
- Eliminated intermediate `update_flight_airports` step
- More intuitive agent workflow

### 2. **Better Agent Performance**
- GPT-4.1 optimized prompting increases reliability
- "Think out loud" planning reduces errors
- Clear examples guide correct tool usage

### 3. **Easier Maintenance**
- Fewer tools to maintain
- Single source of truth for airport resolution
- Clear documentation in prompt

### 4. **Improved Error Handling**
- Better tool response messages
- Clearer instructions when fields missing
- Explicit next steps for agent

## Example Usage

```javascript
// User: "Find flights from Nellore to Goa on Dec 15"

// Step 1: Agent calls flight_search
flight_search({
  origin: "Nellore",
  destination: "Goa",
  outbound_date: "2025-12-15"
})
// → Tool returns: "Missing origin_iata, dest_iata. Use web_search..."

// Step 2: Agent searches for IATA codes
web_search("Nellore airport IATA code...")
// → Finds: TIR (Tirupati, 120km away)

web_search("Goa airport IATA code")
// → Finds: GOI

// Step 3: Agent calls flight_search with IATA codes
flight_search({
  origin: "Nellore",
  origin_iata: "TIR",
  origin_airport_name: "Tirupati Airport",
  origin_distance_km: 120,
  destination: "Goa",
  destination_iata: "GOI",
  outbound_date: "2025-12-15",
  // ... other params
})
// → Tool calls API and returns flight results
```

## Alignment with GPT-4.1 Best Practices

### ✅ Persistence
- Prompt explicitly tells agent to keep going until task complete
- Clear termination conditions

### ✅ Tool-Calling
- Strong emphasis on using tools vs guessing
- Clear tool descriptions with examples
- Proper tool field definitions in API

### ✅ Planning & Chain-of-Thought
- Prompt encourages "thinking out loud"
- Example shows internal reasoning process
- 5-step workflow provides structure

### ✅ Instruction Following
- Clear, specific instructions
- Pre-response checklist
- Success factors enumerated

### ✅ Delimiters
- Uses markdown sections clearly
- Code blocks for examples
- Emoji markers for visual scanning

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with various city combinations**:
   - Major cities with airports (Delhi, Mumbai)
   - Cities without airports (Nellore)
   - International destinations

2. **Test partial information**:
   - User provides only destination
   - User provides only dates
   - Missing passenger count

3. **Test multi-turn conversations**:
   - User changes dates mid-search
   - User asks for different cabin class
   - User switches from roundtrip to oneway

4. **Verify CheapOair loyalty**:
   - Confirm no other booking sites mentioned
   - Deeplink always included
   - Web search results properly attributed

## Summary

The Flight Specialist Agent has been successfully upgraded to:
- Use only 2 tools (flight_search + web_search)
- Follow GPT-4.1 prompting best practices
- Provide clearer guidance to the LLM
- Simplify the workflow while maintaining functionality

This creates a more reliable, maintainable, and efficient agent that better leverages GPT-4.1's agentic capabilities.
