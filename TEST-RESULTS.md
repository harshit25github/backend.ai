## Additional Verifications ✅

### suggestedQuestions (Silent Capture)
- ✅ **3 questions captured** in context
- ✅ Questions NOT mentioned in response text
- Questions are from user perspective asking agent:
  - "What are the best areas to stay in Tokyo?"
  - "How do I get around in Tokyo?"
  - "What are some must-try foods in Japan?"

### placesOfInterest (Consistent Population)
- ✅ **5 places** consistently populated throughout all updates
- Places remain accurate to destination (Tokyo):
  - Senso-ji Temple
  - Tokyo Tower
  - Akihabara
  - Shibuya Crossing
  - Nikko National Park

### Field Naming
- ✅ Using `pax` (not passenger_count): **2**
- ✅ Using `placesOfInterest` (not placesOfInterests)
- ✅ All fields properly structured as objects/arrays

### Context Persistence
- ✅ All updates persisted correctly across requests
- ✅ Context loaded properly between messages
- ✅ No data loss during updates

## Final Context State

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "origin": { "city": "Mumbai", "iata": "BOM" },
    "destination": { "city": "Tokyo", "iata": "NRT" },
    "outbound_date": "2026-07-15",
    "return_date": "2026-07-22",
    "duration_days": 7,
    "pax": 2,
    "budget": {
      "amount": 300000,
      "currency": "INR",
      "per_person": false
    },
    "tripTypes": [],
    "placesOfInterest": [ /* 5 places */ ],
    "suggestedQuestions": [ /* 3 questions */ ]
  },
  "itinerary": {
    "days": [ /* 7 complete days with segments */ ]
  }
}
```

---

## Performance Notes

- **Initial itinerary creation**: ~30-60 seconds
- **Budget update**: ~20-30 seconds
- **Duration update (5→7 days)**: ~60-90 seconds (generates 2 new days)
- **Segment modification**: ~40-60 seconds
- **Add activity**: ~40-60 seconds

**Note:** Duration changes take longer as the agent needs to generate complete new day structures with morning/afternoon/evening segments.
