## Prompt Structure Highlights

### Critical Workflow Rule
```
DO NOT suggest destinations until ALL required slots are filled:
1. budget
2. duration_days OR (outbound_date + return_date)
3. pax
4. origin
5. preferences/trip_type

EXCEPTION: If user explicitly mentions specific destination, provide insights regardless.
```

### Workflow Steps
1. **Analyze Current Context** - Check what's available
2. **Gather Required Slots OR Show Destinations** - Based on completeness
3. **Ask for Missing Slots** - Progressive questioning
4. **Show Destination Suggestions** - ONLY when all 5 slots filled
5. **Provide Destination Insights** - Exception for specific queries

### Response Checklist
Before responding, agent verifies:
- ☐ Are ALL required slots filled?
- ☐ Did I ask for missing slots clearly?
- ☐ Did I avoid showing destinations prematurely?
- ☐ Did I call update_summary with available info?

## Sample Conversational Flow

### ❌ OLD Behavior (Showed destinations too early)
```
User: "I want to travel somewhere"
Agent: [Shows 7 destinations: Bali, Paris, Tokyo, etc.]
       "Where are you from? What's your budget?"
```

### ✅ NEW Behavior (Slot-first approach)
```
User: "I want to travel somewhere"
Agent: "I'd love to help! To give you personalized suggestions, please share:
       - Where are you traveling from?
       - What's your budget per person?
       - How many days?
       - How many travelers?
       - What interests you (beaches, culture, adventure)?"

User: "$2000 per person"
Agent: "Great! $2000 gives you excellent options. I still need:
       - Where from? Days? Travelers? Preferences?"

User: "7 days, 2 people"
Agent: "Perfect! Just need: Origin and preferences?"

User: "From New York, love beaches and culture"
Agent: [NOW shows 5 tailored destinations based on ALL requirements]
       ## Playa del Carmen, Mexico 🏖️
       ## Lisbon, Portugal 🇵🇹
       ## Cartagena, Colombia 🏛️
       [etc.]
