see i think we tking out the IATA code through web_search i have recieved one function in which u can add the city name/iata (make sure user city is correct) then its provide the city iata code nearest to searched location itself for  our testt we can create our own function  where we hardcode  10-20  cities iata code  , so can u suggest how we vcan add this in our current workflow do we add directly add it to the flight_search tool or separately tool use it as different like we were doing in the web_search , please suggest first how should we move forward .
