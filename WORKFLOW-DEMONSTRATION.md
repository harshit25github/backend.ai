see i think we tking out the IATA code through web_search i have recieved one function in which u can add the city name (make user city is correct) then its provide the city code itself for  
  our trest we can create our own function just 10-20  city to ttest it , so can u suggest how we vcan add this in our current workflow do we add directly add it to the flight_search tool or   
  separately use it as different like we were doing in the web_search , please suggest first how should we move forward .
