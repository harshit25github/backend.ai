## 🔍 Key Observations

### 1. Context Persistence ✅
Every piece of information provided by the user is retained:
- Turn 1: Destination → Persisted through all 10 turns
- Turn 2: Duration, interests → Persisted and used in itinerary
- Turn 3: Origin, passengers → Persisted
- Turn 4: Dates, budget → Persisted and used for calculations
- Modifications: All changes properly saved

### 2. Auto-Calculations Working ✅
**Return Date:**
```javascript
// Turn 4: User provides outbound + duration
outbound_date: "2026-03-15"
duration_days: 10
return_date: "2026-03-25"  // ✅ Automatically calculated

// Turn 10: Duration changes
duration_days: 7
return_date: "2026-03-22"  // ✅ Automatically recalculated
```

### 3. Suggested Questions ✅
**Perspective:** User asking agent (not agent asking user)

Examples:
- ✅ "What are the best cities to visit in Japan?"
- ✅ "How do I travel between Tokyo and Kyoto?"
- ✅ "What are must-visit attractions in Tokyo and Kyoto?"

(NOT agent-asking-user like: ❌ "Would you like me to book flights?")

### 4. Segment Structure ✅
**New format (Gateway Agent):**
```json
"morning": [{
  "place": "Senso-ji Temple",
  "duration_hours": 3,
  "descriptor": "Historic temple exploration"
}]
```

**Old format (removed):**
```json
"morning": [{
  "places": "Senso-ji Temple, Nakamise Shopping Street, Asakusa",
  "duration_hours": 3,
  "descriptor": "Historic Asakusa exploration"
}]
```

### 5. Duration Sync (Critical Feature!) ✅
When itinerary length changes, summary auto-updates:
```javascript
// Before: 10-day itinerary
itinerary.days.length: 10
summary.duration_days: 10
summary.return_date: "2026-03-25"

// User requests: "shorten to 7 days"
[update_itinerary] Auto-synced summary.duration_days: 7
[update_itinerary] Auto-recalculated return_date: 2026-03-22

// After: 7-day itinerary
itinerary.days.length: 7
summary.duration_days: 7  // ✅ Auto-synced
summary.return_date: "2026-03-22"  // ✅ Auto-recalculated
```
