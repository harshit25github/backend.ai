# Backend.AI Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ✅ suggestedQuestions Leaking into Response Text
**Problem:** suggestedQuestions were being mentioned in the assistant's response text instead of being captured silently.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added explicit instructions in `src/ai/prompts.js` (lines 598-606):
  - "**NEVER NEVER NEVER mention or list these questions in your text response to the user**"
  - Clarified that questions are captured via tools and displayed separately by frontend
  - Agent must NOT include them in response text

**Verification:**
- ✅ Server logs show questions are captured in context (3 questions)
- ✅ Questions NOT appearing in response text
- ✅ Test output shows: `suggestedQuestions: 3 questions`

---

### 2. ✅ placesOfInterest Missing from update_summary Tool
**Problem:** The `update_summary` tool definition was completely missing the `placesOfInterest` parameter, making it impossible for agents to capture this data via the tool.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `placesOfInterest` parameter to tool schema in `src/ai/multiAgentSystem.js` (lines 291-294)
- Added handler to save placesOfInterest to context (line 339)
- Updated few-shot examples in prompts.js to show expected usage

**Verification:**
- ✅ All tests show 5 places consistently populated
- ✅ Context file contains placesOfInterest array with 5 Paris landmarks
- ✅ Server logs: "Added 5 places for Paris"

---

### 3. ✅ Unclear When to Call update_itinerary
**Problem:** Agent was calling `update_itinerary` inappropriately or not calling it when needed.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added "TOOL CALLING RULES (CRITICAL)" section in `src/ai/prompts.js` (lines 742-752)
- Specified WHEN to call update_itinerary:
  - Creating NEW itinerary (after user confirmation)
  - MODIFYING existing itinerary (changes to days/segments/places/activities/duration)
  - User requests like "add a day", "change Day 2", "swap morning and afternoon"
- Specified WHEN NOT to call:
  - Just discussing trip or asking questions
  - General advice without actual itinerary changes

**Verification:**
- ✅ Itinerary NOT created during information gathering (Steps 1-2)
- ✅ Itinerary created after user confirmation (Step 3)
- ✅ Context shows complete 5-day itinerary with all segments

---

### 4. ✅ suggestedQuestions Not Being Populated
**Problem:** Quick test showed `suggestedQuestions = 0` even though placesOfInterest was working.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added explicit rule in prompts.js: "**ALWAYS include suggestedQuestions** (3-6 questions) on EVERY call"
- Clarified questions must be from USER perspective asking the AGENT

**Verification:**
- ✅ Context file shows 3 suggestedQuestions:
  - "What are the best neighborhoods to stay in Paris?"
  - "What transportation options are available from CDG airport to the city?"
  - "What are some must-try foods in Paris?"

---

### 5. ✅ Field Naming Standardization
**Problem:** Inconsistent field names across codebase (passenger_count vs pax, placesOfInterests vs placesOfInterest).

**Fix Applied:**
- Standardized to: `pax` (not passenger_count), `placesOfInterest` (not placesOfInterests)
- Updated all routes: chat.js, chat-with-db.js, chat-pg.js
- Updated database defaults in conversationDb.js
- Updated few-shot examples in prompts.js

**Verification:**
- ✅ Context shows: `"pax": 2`
- ✅ Context shows: `"placesOfInterest": [...]`
- ✅ All tests use correct field names

## Test Results

### Test: Itinerary Creation Flow
**File:** `test-itinerary-updates.js`

**STEP 1: Initial trip request** ✅
- Response: Information gathering (no premature itinerary)
- Destination: Paris
- Duration: 5 days
- Pax: 2
- Itinerary created: NO (correct - waiting for confirmation)

**STEP 2: Provide complete details** ✅
- Origin: New York
- Budget: USD 3000 (total for 2 people)
- Budget per person: false
- Itinerary created: NO (correct - still waiting for confirmation)

**STEP 3: User confirms - create itinerary** ✅
- Itinerary created: YES (5 days)
- All days have title, date, and segments (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Budget in summary: 3000
- placesOfInterest: 5 places
- suggestedQuestions: 3 questions

### Context Verification ✅
**File:** `data/contexts/itinerary-updates-1759846359596_context.json`

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "pax": 2,
    "origin": { "city": "New York", "iata": "JFK" },
    "destination": { "city": "Paris", "iata": "CDG" },
    "budget": { "currency": "USD", "per_person": false, "amount": 3000 },
    "duration_days": 5,
    "placesOfInterest": [ /* 5 places */ ],
    "suggestedQuestions": [ /* 3 questions */ ]
  },
  "itinerary": {
    "days": [ /* 5 complete days with segments */ ]
  }
